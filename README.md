## About

Data Science Engineering student at INSEA (Class of 2028) building end-to-end machine learning systems with emphasis on:

- Forecasting & time series modeling  
- Transformer architectures  
- Structured ML pipelines  
- Production-oriented design  
- Model uncertainty & evaluation rigor  

I focus on building systems that are reproducible, modular, and deployment-aware.

## Engineering Philosophy

I treat ML projects as systems, not notebooks.

- Clear separation of concerns  
- Deterministic pipelines  
- Metrics before models  
- Interpretability before deployment  
- Architecture over hacks
